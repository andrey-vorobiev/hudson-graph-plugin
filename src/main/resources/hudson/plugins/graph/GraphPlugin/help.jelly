    <div>
      Plots data across builds.
      Data for the plots are pulled from your build workspace after a build completes.
      Each plot can have one or more lines (called data series).
      <p/>
      Here is an example of the plots generated by this plugin:
      <p align="center">
        <img src="${rootURL}/plugin/graph/images/examplePlot.png" />
      </p>
    </div>
  </f:block>
